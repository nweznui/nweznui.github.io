hello! as you may have noticed... i've reorganized my journal. i kind of found the other one cumbersome to use, too
needlessly complicated, and unpleasant to look at. this version is so much easier to type in.. really should've used iframes sooner.
i'll probably find a way to automate generating entries so that all i have to do is create a new html file of my text, 
run a bash script then it'll generate an iframe and a div entry for me. shouldn't be too hard to do, i'm just kinda lazy.
