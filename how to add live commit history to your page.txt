how to add live commit history to your page!

so, i found manually updating my index page with updates kinda tedious... and wanted to utilize my commit history!
note this assumes you have already set up a git repo for your site. it's super easy, this took me an hour to figure out but probably will only take 10 minutes to set up.

here's a tutorial on how i did that:

1. create a .sh script. if you like my formatting feel free to copy/paste, otherwise you can find documentation on how to customize it here: https://git-scm.com/docs/pretty-formats

#!/bin/bash

git log --pretty=format:"%as, %ar%n note: %s" > update_history_commits.txt 

echo "commit history fetched!"

2. make a link to your file. this is so we are clean!

3. make your script executable. make sure you include the path:

chmod +x fetch_commit_history.sh

4. cd to your .git folder and open your config file. under alias, paste the following:
	xpush = !git push $1 $2 && fetch_commit_history.sh 

5.
